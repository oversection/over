        <p>the confusion i have about describing roy, it was in development that he was stated as something that isn't human, isn't an animal yet is something that is created. Roy is an artificial human being made for the sole purpose of being a punisher towards their sworn brothers (the crowns (honestly i almost forgot about the existence of crowns)) in case the crowns learn to become human.
            it feels contradictory that Roy's entire motif is to rely on data and enforces animal instincts when, he explores his identity? or maybe im overthinking it and his lolita persona is just. a disguise. lol.
            i think he's an amazing character with greats potential. denying human acts and feelings, having no moral ground, has calculated actions and behaviours, yada. this why ana likes them hwwhhw i miss them
        </p>
        <P>Anaroy is also like . me watching two creatures in a cage. Ever since I made Ana, it was to make as if she's more insane than Roy, and roy digs it. 
            Roy truly admired Ana for how she has a fixation on committing actions without getting consequences.

        <p>Interaction chart based on how many characters know/acknowledge each other in their life. Some start from simple explanations like "they grew up together" "they had a crush" up to "they cursed each other with envy and is unforgiven for their entire life". seems like Vent is the winner! so much for being so quiet. Chloris being the most distant seems fitting. You were morphed against your will and noone acknowledges it. cool!</p>

        </summary>
        <p>Sober;s characterization used to focus a lot on the reality of queer/minoroties living inside a place like Indonesia. During 2021-2022 I heavily focused on writing adult/mature atmospheres, alas a lot of events happening was set in nighttime and of course, as the title was created in this timeframe, Sober used to be heavily focused on Vent's drinking problem. That's all. I kind of regret giving SOber it's name with the way things are now, but since Sober doesn't really need the context of alcohol to stand its meaning, sure, what the hell.
            Each character back then was written like they were held at gunpoint to say something woke. I'm confident to point at myself that back then I knew nothing about queer people in real life (despite me being one) and was diluted of how hey act online. THANKFULLY, nobody's being held at gunpoint to say something so shattering about themselves to the camera for sympathy points.
        </p>
        <p>Now, as the events written were more serious, I've managed to tone the theme down while it's there subconnsciously. Well, one character you could guess to be queer first is Jett, because of course, his entire character is about being trapped in a body you hate and being ripped off your facade. Other characters in sober don't have the same plot as him, so while their behaviour stands out of them the most, their queerness is still there. It's just in the form of symbolism!</p>
        <p>For example, i said that Vent's gender is undictated, or maybe with some other characters i said this too. Well, because their story doesn't change no matter what gender they are, while Jett's gender is integral to his character. I believe for these characters, their gender is just whatever anyone interprets it because they're well...fictional! they're all a little queer. And it's mostly shaped by their environment, those who give clues.</p>

        <p>Exactly as it says. Andrajett has been a side-focus for quite some time, even though they have existed far way back then (only as an idea and conflict point),
            and for the recent months I've been fleshing them out little by little. I won't dive just right into their relationship, because i feel like 
            their backgrounds 
            play a part into how they act towards each other too. Most especially seen in Andra because well, Don't we all already know how jett is like? 
            I took this chance and place to talk about him.
        </p>
        <p>Andra is a well-known student in high school. He's most known for his ambitiousness for learning, yet very outgoing kind. How he behaves is just as how a student 
    from a prestigious family would, not. 
    He doesn't really boast about his wealth, but rather about his looks and personality and the kind of person he's going to be. He swears to be the
     successful runt of the family. He's cooperative, sociable, knowledgeable, all out of spite.
    Truthfully, he didn't want to be burdened by these heavy expectations, but it feels like he was born with it. As much as he wanted to enjoy life, 
    He can't let himself enjoy it until he reaches it. 
        </p>
        <p>He realizes he can push himself up when he pushes others down. Especially as a method to lash out from his family's pressure. 
    He targets mostly girls and women who succeed better than him.
   And since he gathered friends around that circumstance, he learned that he could do something he could get away from. Objectifying people.
    And it grew to become an addiction he found pleasing.
   Of course, he approached this method shamefully at first. During this time, there is one teacher that assists Andra and has become one adult
    that Andra trusts, which is Mr. Vincent.
    He led Andra into further methods and further sickening ideas, and treated Andra like a toy of mindless desire. 
    </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Bloodlines are seperated into to two; Andaraka (darkness) and Prakasa (light)
        the cause of this is due to darkness's collapsed on itself-- creating light. That light scattered, some into stars, and some into glowing dust. 
        Before that event, darkness was the ever-expanding landscape. Darkness has been living with their own energy and lived as beings with inhumane forms.
        The stars that scattered, evolved into life. they became human, and as curiosity is born with humans, they discovered the darkness that surround them were alive. 
        Darkness(Andaraka) acted upon first, to make a rule with the creator of Prakasa (Jiwa), to never let any of her creations kill the darkness.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">The doctor is one of ana's excellent  servants. although he is smart, he does not have a heart. his only love of collecting, to serve as memento or as 'prizes' for himself. 

              has a twisted moral of objectifying or dehumanizing people inferior. gains their trust, dissects them, and takes their truth. 
              
              his dreamscape consists of subjects pinned and taxidermies 
              and varieties of collections; from body parts to mundane everyday things. set in a very brutalism interior. if you think of it its like a basement i guess....
              i guess one thing i like about thinking about this is about how both jett and andra are 'tainted'. like. in some ways. however jett puts up a facade, whereas andra is a whole disgusting  being and is embracing. like a bit of sawa nakamura. i guess ana's servants reflect some of ana's influenced traits.</p>

    </summary>
     <p>
        im really just wondering how long it would take for me to actually produce sober. then again, i dont know if im actually serious. when is exactly the 'start' and 'finish'?
     </p>
     <P>here's what i think sober would be converted to as a consumable; seperated from each's purpose and content,
     </P>
     <p>the foundation is the prakasa-andaraka/this foundation is called 'prakreasi'. this includes the birth of revolution caused by the misuse of art, [1] which includes ana and jiwa's union and ana's change in perception due to jiwa creating 'prakasa'. i think this could be better converted into a visual experience. dialogue is not important in this part, but probably a narrator? i guess it could be a picture video.</p>
     <p>
So we're getting right on to the archivist-variant/pralestari first to show its purpose: oversee fate and preserve every creation, whatever form it takes so that passion never dies. pralestari jett was born to be proof of neutrality, and serves as a vessel to showcase the consequence of any rule broken. i think it would be cool if it were to be a game where you (Pralestari Jett pov?) classify what's art and what's not--while maintaining universes by "donating" pieces or items to sort of 'console' them to avoid breaking fates... what's this game category called again? management simulator? i guess. so yeah. that sounds cool!

            <li>
                <p style="font-weight:bolder">ANA</p>
                <p>Ana is a refined woman with ridiculously high standards and makes it hard to resist due to her alluring appearance. 
                    (artistically and anatomically) experimental, fearless, and curious, her ability to be able to 
                    control, warp other’s dreamscapes to her interests makes her unstoppable and seemingly incapable 
                    of being marked down as a criminal. Because its just a dream. </p>
                <p>On the surface, she cares deeply of her child(ren), giving each of them a purpose 
                    and raising them to strictly follow that path. Under the hopeful intentions, 
                    Ana is considered manipulative, egoistic, and solipsistic, truthfully. To hide 
                    those, she appears sexy and elegant.</p>
                <p>Her innate desire is to become everything. Man, animal, dead, dust, interstellar 
                    creature, celestial object, fruit, but what she wanted the most, was to be a caring
                     mother. To have a child from her own flesh and blood, and to see what really 
                     results from her existence. This leads to the birth of Harap, her son. 
                </p>
                <p>design key elements:</p>
                <p>a. She's always smiling.</p>
                <p>b. Her eyes are marked with a tear on her ey ebags. This is not a tattoo or a scar;
                    It's merely a design choice to differeniate eyes from others.
                </p>
                <p>c. One of her eyes is odd, drawn as a scribble.</p>
                <p>d. The flower on her head is a 'bunga kembang sepatu' or known as  a chinese hibiscus/mallowrose.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="font-weight:bolder">Jett</p>
                <p>an outgoing, social old-fashioned loverboy who used to rock. He is admired by others for his friendliness and 
                    distinct silhouette from others. he appeals to everyone, and yet there's always something in the 
                    back of his mind that makes him think he's alienated despite everything. sometimes full of himself 
                    because he thinks he's got it the worst. this causes a lot of conflict involving selfishness and 
                    invalidating other's trauma. but that behaviour only happened in the past.</p>
                <p>has some detachment towards his identity, somewhere in the line of being a 'fraud' to everyone.
                    besides that, he used to have a passion for writing(fanfiction) and composing songs. 
                    pretty much lived in the internet from a young age. he's grown to have a wide range of taste in 
                    music(generally rock) and fiction media because of that.
                </p>
                <p>his traits as he becomes an adult with responsibilities, he handles things fine. 
                    he can stand up for himself. what's important to him is to balance between being 
                    'himself' and being a dog to society.</p>
                <p><b>Fun Facts:</b></p>
                <p>- If he were a dog, he'd be a german shepherd.</p>
                <p>- Used (keyword) to compose songs using Vsynths like Vocaloid or UTAU. his music style resembles that of Abu-Se-KenP's.</p>
                <p>- Absolutely nuts over sea food</p>
        
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="font-weight:bolder">CHLORIS </p>
                <p>The older sister of Jett. Oftentimes mistaken as hotheaded and silent, but is really just tired 
                    and bullshits her way through. always found unfocused and unmannered, Chloris used to be forced 
                    to join many extracurriculars in point to make her somewhat more successful than her mother. 
                    Ballet, Dokcil, Robotics...</p>
                <p>This causes her to think that she has to be productive all the time to not disappoint 
                    her mother for making all the extracurricular she goes through go to waste. 
                    that's why her mother suggested going to either go to med school or engineering.</p>
                <p>Chloris went to being a surgeon. joining the hundreds of operation meetings, department drama, and consulting with the hundreds of 
                    patients facing their cries, burnt her out and now only capable of enhancing her skills further as a surgeon.</p>
                <p>
Chloris's relationship with Jett is somewhat. hard to explain. you could say it's enviness--Jett's treatment by his mother is different from Chloris. 
Jett was treated with more freedom(regret after mother realizing that she pushed Chloris too hard) thus by this freedom, Jett didnt feel like he's as good as Chloris.
 Even though their mother never compared them to each other, Jett constantly thinks he's not good enough for his family.
  Making himself force to abandon his passion of writing/composing and went to accounting. </p>
                <p><b>Fun Fact</b></p>
                <p>- Chloris has a discomfort towards looking at fast food, especially hamburgers. despite looking unmannered, she's very mindful about eating in front of others. 
                    Chloris also has a small appetite, and doesn't eat much.</p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod">born from my thoughts, all collided.
never seen before, light bursted and scattered outwards to the endless, each carrying a life.
stars and dust lives atop the void.</p>
    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod">the source of light, i held so dear. it was like my own child.
but every finger pointed at me, as i was a curse.
as if i littered the world with passion.
my own was taken away.</p>
    <p>One of the scattered light (prakasa) come awoke.
never seen before, a human with passion alike to its creator.
born with curiosity, he went to see the others alike.</p>
    <p>it was as twice as his size, yet it was shining dimly.
and trapped, frozen from hatching. it was stopped from something uncertain. 
    </p>
    <p style="color:olivedrab">"so the newborn has awoken."</p>
    <p style="color:olivedrab">"this passion should belongs to me, it is only fair aligned with my beauty."</p>
    <p>i felt cold in my behalf.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center">--pralestari--</p>
    <p>(closes book) and i grew to watch over all the light that is born.
so that none are taken away, lost.</p>
    <p>but of course, not every life can be saved. 
i worked too hard to prevent that from happening
 and overlooked everything else.</p>
    <p>one life killed, one life loved, one life led, one life stood.
life is infinite, and as long as they live, this place stays up.
</p>
    <p>today is one of mine's birthday,
one life that i look forward to grow.
i wish there was a way to meet him in person.</p>
    <p>he may know who i am, he may know what he did, he may know what he means to exist.
so i am making something in hopes that he knows how proud i am of him.</p>

        <p>once a few times i get to think about chloris being jiwa’s daughter and not at the same time. its just horrible isnt it. your daughter gets modified by your very own enemyand you have to pretend that shes fine and want to genuinely rebond with her but theres this big wall-
            then you have to take care of your son thats not trusting you because they dont believe in the freedom you gave him and you are watching him slowly kill himself and you are trying so hard not to dwell on it and youre genuinely trying to be better towards both of them-
            jiwa how does it feel to have your daughter stolen to become the world’s proof of change and slowly becoming unintelligible as she gets worse and worse?
        </p>
        <p>jiwa how does it feel to have your son be stolen, trapped in the way you used to be and it tunrs out your son caused a cylical disaster and your son could never forgive himself for it and kills himself for being human?
            horrible. depressing. continue living alongside the dreamscape and seperate it from reality but it feels so blurry. it IS realbut its not supposed to be in our daily lives. They know its what they feel internally, they know what they look like internally, but its not justifiable

        <p>So since An doesn't really have any sad or tragic backstory as how it's just them living their life with fun until</p>
        <p>yeah, Shei</p>
        <p>Shei was something they have been fascinated with, seeing Shei as a strong person, a cold and mistaken heart, but has the kindest to hold their hand together and put out th music as their resembling identity...</p>
        <p>An knows Shei likes konstantin, and it brings comfort to her. So...it's just An staying silent unrequited</p>
        <p>An gives Shei a LOT of gifts. and if Shei gives gifts back it becomes little trinkets they would decorate. Just wanted to show the heartbreaking times is when An remembers all their effort for Shei but accepted the fate anyways.</p>
        <p>For example, An wears perfectly matching outfits and does it to comfort Shei around, even trying to go to shei's taste(still in a soft color) but something that would make Shei compliment or smile.</p>
        <p>Another one, An crochets swaters or scarves at night everytime usually at fall-winter for Shei to feel warmth and hope that it reminds Shei of AN</p>
        <p>An extremely falls in love with Shei's guitar skills, combining with their unexpectable loud and explosive style, they try to go beat alongg with it-even when it means to soften their usual style (it is hard actually)</p>
        <p>+An has a litte diary from when they were young, and the contents are filled up with very important things to them. It grows to become a Shei dump-- All about Shei's interest and discomforts, every little things in note. Whenever they feel a little giddy, they sing as if lyrics of the writings in their diary</p>
        <p>So like all the sweet affectionate memories flooding through their mind while An watches Konstantin n SHei kissing, at the winter, at christmas, at Konstantin's birthday.</p>
        <p>Since it isn't their birthday, after all.</p>
        <p>Sweet affectionate memories are just their hard working supporting love in An's POV, but in She's POV, It's just a friendly comforting memory.</p>
        <p>(But they knew acting out on their jealousy is useless...so she just smiles...)</p>
        <p>An watches from afar, shaky breaths in the snow cold winter, gripping on their handmade scarf, as the view sickens her mind...slowly...heavy...and blurs in their vision. Then all of that dissapears, as they greet the hurt infront of them with their usual smile.</p>

            <p>imagine it as being the placce where your inner self lives when you sleep. Dreamscapes are built to represent one's past, emotional state, and desires.
I mean in short, i guess technically it is llike an alternate universe of yourself. an alternate universe where you are playing a role in the appearance of your 'true self'.</p>
            <p>for example, jett's dreamscape form aka true self, is portrayed as a crumbled hollow porcelain statue. the 'true form' of characters are mainly based on metaphors and symbolism and it depends whether you're an Andaraka/Prakasa. Since Andaraka in its nature are mostly fantasized animals, Prakasa is a light that bends.
one's true form doess not have memories of thingss out of the dreamscape, but a person can remember what happened in their dreamscapes. (i doont even know if thats necesssar!! But just take it)</p>
            <p>when you sleep and become conscious in the dreamscape, ou dont have memories of the real life. But your real life consciousnesss can remember what happened in the dream, and mostly, people who experience dreamscapes dont forget what their dreams are.
</p>
            <p>Dreamscapes are mainly a place to reflect on things. or simply a calm personal place, but it depends on each individual's personalities...</p>
            <p>I have this picture from 2024 of some dreamscape creatures (certifiedly outdated, but im just not in the mood to redesign stuff againhshfj</p>

        <p>with a fortune, ana has the unfortunate ability to control other's dreamscapes and what occurs in them.
she has broad curiosity with experiments, and wishes to use other's dreamscapes as where her experiments take place.
She could control your dreams to tell the truth, to scare you, to guide you into a path she deems intesting, for her own entertainment.
</p>
        <p>while she's also a mother to her daughter Harap, and a mother(caretaker) to many young orphans, her goal is to make every children useful for others and to make sure they are all working efficiently, taught with many lessons to strengthen their manners and to make sure every single move is correct--she cant let a single mistake be seen. what she doesn't get is maybe that they are still young? and they're human children, too. But she's never appeared to be significantly 'bad' to children. Children actually admire her and love her, but they just don't know her true nature. i mean they shouldn't lol</p>
        <p>She was always raised to believe in justice and perfection, which led her to appear 'heartless' for not having sympathy nor empathy towards people that are suffering. She will always defends the truth and law, no matter what.</p>
        <p>ana also is conscious of the existence of crowns. due to the realization, she thought it was a hassle for there to be more than one crown. so she decided to try and see what would happen if she were to obtain all of the crown's purposes and give it all for herself to rule, singlehandedly</p>
        <p>so far she's managed to capture one crown, which is Vent. She continues to remake him to be human, and gave him a purpose, which is to see how much humans can write until they reach their limit.

            <p>before they met each other in person, they never realized that the were each other's pen pals. Jett and Vent are both passionate in writing poetry, however it's been long ago since Jett last wrote. He's taken an interest in reading fanfiction since then. Vent continues to study linguistics and has published a lot of his works publicly.</p>
            <p>How the first met each other in real life, was not because they asked to meet, but it was pretty much arranged. Jett used to have a band during college, and as they were searching for a more proper lyricist, vent was introduced. </p>
            <p>They both immediately took an interest in discussing their favorite literature medias, novels, poetry...and realized they are their pen pals. funny...
Then eventually, Vent proved himself worth of Jett's trust, and the shortly confessed their feelings for each other.
</p>
            <p>during this time, they already have graduated together.
</p>
            <p>Problems arise when they realize this relationship can't be kept forever, as Jett decided to set their distances and completely avoid each other for the sake of their reputation's safety.
until someone faked a suicide note; claiming that it was Vent's note. due to this, Jett immediately ran to Vent's place, causing him shortness of breath, all for it to be fake. 
worried as he busted his door open, Vent was shocked to see Jett again. He would be happy to see him, but the state Jett was in was nearing death.
</p>
            <p>after a week, Jett became conscious again--in exchange for the loss of his recent memories, especially about ever being close to Vent.
After he recovered fully, Jett met Vent again--without knowing that much of him besides that he's an amazing writer. He wanted to get closer to Vent, not realizing it was the second time they get close again like this.
due to this, Vent felt uneasy. The reason is that when he thinks of pre-coma Jett, it's quite an unflavorful relationship, and Jett's bitter personality is what comes to mind. and it's hard to change it ever since.
</p>
            <p>Jett confessed his feelings again to Vent, and he decided to give him a second chance. and the both agreed to live in one room together to save their savings. during this time, they already have jobs.
the relationship only got worse, because it's confusing for both of them. Why Vent is ignoring him, and what Vent should do...
</p>
            <p>He made an awful decision by coping with alcohol every single night, which eventually made Jett worry enough to pick him up and drive him home every single time. Jett was patient waiting for Vent to talk about the problem himself...but as the world would not allow it, it unfolds in a dream they share.

        <p>jett often feels academically distant (thus underestimating himself and hasjealousy over chloris’s success,) because jett was treated with more freedom. he shouldbe grateful but..hm
            chloris was treated with more force to be the future punggung kesuksesan/ekonomi keluarga as a dokter, but she didnt fight against it. she doesnt have any othr hobbies, so she went with it. however after jiwa realized that she was forcing her child to be better than her instead of-
            them having their own choice, jiwa stopped forcing things to jett. Jett should be grateful for the freedom he was given with, right? but justru because of how free he is, he didnt have the ‘push’ jiwa did to chloris to make her success, thus jett feelig stuck and useless…
            | thats kinda why he stopped writing and agak maksa masuk akuntasi. so he can atleast get a ‘real job’ (which is…yikes, tbh)

        <p>Roy dolls himself up, extremely bad. If to compare with An, Roy has the upper hand of styling. It is never simple, never common, it is always unique. Everyday you'd find the patterns of his accescories different or the color arranged is always more than one spectrum. But it always has the same feeling you have when you see his fashion:To cover himself,
And it is obvious, but people doesn't take it quite literally. Roy covers himself and hides behind all the decorative colors and style, just to think he would look a bit human or doesnt wants to be seen as a simple pale 'monster' </p>
<p>About An, she is always trying to be pretty and cute, but its never too much. It's because An wants to be seen as someone natural, yet able to show herself up to satisfy other people. It's more like people would know despite whatever aesthetic she comes up with: "Oh, it's An!" something like that...It's merely because An's use of fashion is to make people love them despite whatever they turn out to be in any day (thus why they fell in love with shei that seems to always care for An)
    they are both people who tries to blend in to the society (Roy, to be human. And An, to satisfy people.) and their attempts at trying to love (rom, platonic, or familial) doesn't seem to be going the right path as what they expect to be.

        <p>AN is an act of service...buddy! So she would actually bring up a conversation that could bring up people up to talk, as she has many friends with variety of differences. But an doesn't talk about themselves much except how they like cute clothes and shei lol, maybe something general but not that deep.</p>
        <p>The other way, Roy actually doesn't bring up conversation very well, it's more likely he will bring up a trouble of mischief and it will be...the topic of the day. It's because he thinks it's stupid to talk anything in genuinely or deeply 'cause it will affect him, and he prefers to do actions or small surprising things to interact with people. If he ever interacts seriously in a long conversation, it is only because he wants something in matter.</p>

        <p>these descriptions were made for the former <a href="https://besober.carrd.co">carrd</a> filled with sober's early reality club inspired theme. Please keep in mind that SOME of these informations aren't reliable to be matched up to the current description.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>JETT:</b> A lively and outgoing man with an intense passion for singing. People all around him perceive him as perfect. Despite being "special", he does think of himself as a decent normal human being, just living his life.

He shares his apartment room with Konstantin, which he treats him like his own brother. They tend to argue often and had intents to murder each other (...might be jokingly) because of how annoying they are together. Having to hear Konstantin giving everyday religious advice and rambles already makes Jett nauseous (not literally)

Fun fact: He loves old-fashioned stuff. He gave Vent a mixtape as a way to confess his romantic feelings towards him, and he listens to a lot of 90's or 2000's rock music. Not a fan of quiet stuff. He might fool around shouting or singing when the situation is quiet, which...makes him look kind of akward.
            </li>
            <li><b>KONSTANTIN:</b> A priest who breathes his hobby of gambling, and treating his life "like it's a game," or more famously, a gamble. Konstantin has powerful faith in God, often makes references to the Bible as he speaks. Much of his advice is religion-based. He's known to be religious at times, and "has a pure soul blessed by the god" Konstantin claims. Seems some kind of a troublemaker.

He is currently "dating" Shei, but keeps it a secret due to how unsure he and Shei would live this "love life". He frequently convinces himself that he's in a relationship, meanwhile, Shei denies that fact and confirms that they are just friends.

Fun fact: His father's actions have unintentionally made him act like an old man. He always gets picked on by Jett for it. He's forgetful, and a bit careless.</li>
            <li><b>SHEI:</b>Shei is a part-time fortune teller, finding her way to live through her desperate life. She likes to speak solely in third person, to separate herself from her alter ego.
Shei stutters a lot, but that doesn't really mean Shei's a shy person. Instead, she pretty much likes to curse and states she is suffering during certain moods. Not all people understand how she communicates, and it's only luck that can get people closer to her.
She is very ignorant whenever strangers talk to her. She also lacks discipline sometimes, like hrowing off "fuck off" signs to annoying people. Her close friends are Vanilla, a therapist, and An, a drummer. And her boyfriend Konstantin (whom she disagrees with and only says that they are just friends) is a lucky gambler who always wins the ladies' attention. 
Shei is sometimes unaware of her own actions, which unknowingly may cause harm to people. She visits her therapist to help herself get a better hang of it. Fun fact:
Shei is pretty talented at playing guitar, but she refuses to play in a band because she is bad at keeping track of communication with her bandmates if she had. She sometimes plays together with Jett.</li>
            <li><b>ROY:</b>Roy is seen as a very cheerful, and childish person who seeks fun. He is mistaken as a girl a lot of times, due to his fashion sense and his way of talking. But he doesn't care since it won't trouble him much. Roy's personality can change depending on his situation, although he states that he is innocent, although he can actually be a very tricky person. He likes being clingy and sticks to the crowd anytime he can.

Fun fact:
Roy dislikes boring things, but he likes chess. Its the only thing he won't lose from time to time. </li>

roleplaying is normal...in fact we should bring it back !!
<p style="text-align: left;">over: if someone did something bad to you, would you take revenge?</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">VENT(SHROT): i wish i could, but I'd rather hide those kinds of ideas. No matter how i want to, I'll just compress my anger and forgive them at the end, even though that 'forgiveness' wasn't so pure, i guess.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">over: i see...you don't want to cause any harm, even if you might want to?</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">VENT(SHROT): yes</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">over: okay and if someone gets treated badly, do you defend the victim or not?</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">VENT(SHROT): depends, but I would most likely do. I mean, I could never defend strangers that easily, but that kind of empathy i have in my heart, I couldn't hold it. so i help them when they are in a really bad situation. If it's someone I know, I would use all my strength to help them. I don't want to have a regret later on if i ignore it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">over: alright. thank you for your answers, that's all i need</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">SHROT: sobbing because roy killed him but vent will still forgive him, taking away his life :)</p>
